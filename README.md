# machineJobScheduler

This program assigns the maximum number of jobs to a given number of machines. The jobs have a start and finish time and are assigned using a greedy algorithm. The user enters a txt file specifying the number of jobs, the number of machines, and the start and finish times associated with the jobs. The program will output the number of jobs it was able to schedule along with the scheduled Job Numbers in line with the machine it was assigned to.
